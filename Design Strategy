We will be dividing the processor design in multiple stages according to how an instruction is implemented
from fetching stage to all the way down to Write Back stage.

We will be developing 5 VHDL modules, 1 for each stage namely:
Instruction Fetch
Instruction Decode
Execution/ALU
Memory Stage
Control Unit

A top module in which all these modules will be initiated, register and data memory values will be displayed on 7 segment.

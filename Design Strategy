We will be dividing the processor design in multiple stages according to how an instruction is implemented
from fetching stage to all the way down to Write Back stage.

I will be developing 5 VHDL modules, 1 for each stage namely:
Instruction Fetch
Instruction Decode
Execution/ALU
Memory Stage
Write Back

We need to develop one more module named **Control** module which will update the **Program Counter(PC)** based
on the type of instrcution being executed, whether it is a **JUMP** or a **Branch** instruction etc.

Then we will instantiate all these modules in the main file. We should be able all this by Thursday.
